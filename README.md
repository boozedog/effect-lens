# Effect Lens

Effect Lens is an advisory tool for Effect v4 TypeScript development.

It will combine the local Effect guidance in `../effect/LLMS.md` with TypeScript AST and type analysis to help agents design, review, and improve Effect code. Findings are evidence-backed suggestions, not authoritative rewrites.

Planned surfaces:

- `effect_lens_lookup` for local Effect guidance and source lookup.
- `effect_lens_review` for AST/type-aware code review.
- `effect_lens_design` for Effect-first implementation guidance.

The first implementation will be small, read-only, and Effect-first itself.
